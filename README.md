## ‚ú® Welcome to my new chapter ‚ú®

I'm Tina - English Language and Literature student with interest in data!<br>

My learning has had many paths and interests - from wine and tastings, TEFL courses, and now coding and data. With each new chapter I enrich my life with new people, and new knowledge that I expand on in my free time.<br>
<br>
How did I end up with this new interest in data, when my degree is humanities focused?<br>
I enjoy language and literature and have decided to take that degree path as personal development. While on the path, I came to a conclusion that while I love reading, literature on university level is not my thing, but I still wanted to finish what I started - you live and you learn. üíî<br>
<br>
On the other side, I realised that I really have a knack for language analysis through pattern recognition, and how might specific use of syntax affect the reader/listener.<br>
This made a lot of sense once I thought about it more, as during all of my hosptality days I was always hooked on analysing sales and keeping track of product popularity, so it should not have come as a surprise that I enjoyed critical analysis of date - be it numbers or language.<br>
<br>
Once I transitioned into an office environment, and had to keep track of data and information more often using Excel, I enjoyed having visible record to look back on and refer when necessary. And so I decided to look into data analysis more!<br>

I heard about CFG through a friend and once uni calmed down a bit, decided to have a go at their SQL Kickstarter course - it felt like a logical start considering that I have had some experience with analysing and data, rather than jumping into completely unfamiliar languages straight away - I always found it fun that pragramming also has 'languages' and would love to add more to my repertoire. <br>
<br>
In 8 weeks with CFG I have learned the basics of SQL, made a small database project and I was hooked!<br>
Now I've made GitHub to keep myself accountable and so I have something to officially update as I make my future projects.<br>
